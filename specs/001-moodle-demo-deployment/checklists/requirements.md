# Specification Quality Checklist: Moodle Demo Site Deployment

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-03
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The technology stack (DigitalOcean, Docker Compose, Traefik, Bitnami Moodle, MariaDB, Redis, GitHub Actions) has been captured in the Assumptions section as user-specified constraints rather than embedded in functional requirements, keeping requirements technology-agnostic.
- Theme selection (compatible open-source Moodle theme) is documented as an assumption; no specific theme name is mandated by the spec, preserving flexibility for the planning phase.
